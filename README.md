# Turtle Race
A simple turtle racing game built with Python's turtle module. The program will prompt the user to input a turtle color to place a bet on. The turtles will then move randomly across the screen and the program will determine which turtle wins the race. If the user's selected turtle wins, they will be informed that they have won, and if not, they will be informed that they have lost.
